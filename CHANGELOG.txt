=== 1.1.1 ===

- Removed duplicate transaction status

=== 1.1 ===

- Improved subtotal column of PurchasedItem admin

=== 1.0 ===

- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: get_items_and_qantities must return 3-tuple
  Before this change we were only saving the quantity of a purchased item and
  it's transaction. This is not sufficient for transactions that have more than
  one item. From now on we will save quantity and price at the time of purchase
  and optinally a GFK to anything so that we can remember what this item was
  about. We also have the new field 'identifier' which allows us to calculate
  sums for certain types of items for a transaction (i.e. only shipping costs).
- For your current shop you must make sure that your implementation of
  get_items_and_quantities now reuturns a list of 3-tuples:
  [(item, quantity, content_object), ...]
- You can probably easily achieve that by just returning ``None`` for the
  content object and everything shoudl still work as before.

=== 0.6 ===

- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES!
- field renamed from payerID to PayerID, which is what PayPal returns. You
  might need to update your templates
- Added redirect parameter to SetExpressCheckoutFormMixin - this enables you
  to use this form with AJAX calls as it will only return the redirect URL
  instead of a HttpResponseRedirect
- Added skip_confirmation attribtue to DoExpressCheckoutView. If you set this
  to true, the confirmation view will not be displayed, instead it's POST
  handler will be executed, just as if the user has clicked the "Confirm"
  button. This allows you to save one click during the checkout process.

- The SetExpressCheckoutItemForm needs to implement a method called
  get_items_and_quantities now. get_item and get_quantity are obsolete now.
- This allows us to hand over more than just one item to paypal
